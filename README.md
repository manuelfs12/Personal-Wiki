# Introduction

Welcome to my personal wiki, here I will share notes, resources and more about things I'm currently learning.

## The Goal

The goal of this wiki is to help me document my learning. I noticed that I consume a huge ammount of information daily, but I never share it or at least write about it. With the help of this wiki, I can have a public space where I can write as much or as little as I want without feeling like I need to produce blog quality content everytime.
